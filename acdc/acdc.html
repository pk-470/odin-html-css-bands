    <h2>Short biography</h2>

    <p>
      AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by
      Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. Their music has been
      variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the
      band themselves call it simply "rock and roll".
    </p>

    <p>
      AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first
      album, 1975's High Voltage. Membership subsequently stabilised around the
      Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark
      Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff
      Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. In
      February 1980, about seven months after the release of their breakthrough
      album Highway to Hell, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night
      of heavy drinking. The group considered disbanding but elected to stay
      together, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's
      replacement. Later that year, the band released their first album with
      Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album
      launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the best
      selling albums of all time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You
      (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States.
      Prior to the release of 1983's Flick of the Switch, Rudd left the band and
      was replaced by Simon Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris Slade in
      1989. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early nineties
      with the release of 1990's The Razors Edge. Rudd returned to the band in
      1994, replacing Slade and appearing on the band's next five albums. Their
      fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of
      2008, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock,
      eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The band's line-up remained the same for twenty years, until 2014 with
      Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia (he died in 2017)
      and Rudd's legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie
      Young, who debuted on AC/DC's 2014 album Rock or Bust, and on its
      accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In
      2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss.
      Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the
      remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background
      vocalist Cliff Williams retired from AC/DC at the end of the Rock or Bust
      tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the
      Rock or Bust lineup was announced in September 2020 and the band's
      seventeenth studio album Power Up was released two months later.

    <p>
      AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75
      million albums in the United States, making them the ninth-highest-selling
      artist in the United States and the 16th-best-selling artist worldwide.
      Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it
      the second-highest-selling album by any artist, and the highest-selling
      album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US, where it
      is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time.[10] AC/DC ranked fourth on
      VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" and were named the
      seventh "Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC
      ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the "100 Greatest Artists of
      All Time". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the
      Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as "the greatest rock and roll band
      of all time". In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the "100
      Greatest Artists of All Time".
