    <h2>Short biography</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motörhead"><i>from Wikipedia</i></a>

    <p>
      Motörhead were an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by Lemmy
      (lead vocals, bass), Larry Wallis (guitar) and Lucas Fox (drums). Lemmy
      was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are
      often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which
      re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several
      guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their
      best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil "Philthy Animal"
      Taylor and guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Motörhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation
      albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio,
      they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful
      singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades
      and, particularly, the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented
      Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number
      26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, they have sold
      more than 15 million albums worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with
      being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and
      speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a
      rock and roll band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands,
      but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and
      metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good
      versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse and, most
      famously, gambling, the latter theme being the focus of their hit song
      "Ace of Spades".
    </p>

    <p>
      Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive
      heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after
      his death, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed
      that Motörhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Motörhead's
      best-known lineup (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.
