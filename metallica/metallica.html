    <h2>Short biography</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica"><i>from Wikipedia</i></a>

    <p>
      Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in
      Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich,
      and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's
      fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of
      the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax
      and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and
      primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk
      Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on
      to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron
      McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

      Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third
      album, Master of Puppets (1986), often cited as one of the heaviest and
      most influential thrash metal albums. The band's next album, ...And
      Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination.
      Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first not to root
      predominantly in thrash metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience,
      achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million
      copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of
      the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and
      directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal
      roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which
      drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's most
      recent album is Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, released in 2016.

      In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing
      service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed
      lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected
      material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was
      the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of
      Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth
      album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the
      time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
      The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert
      film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed live
      against a fictional thriller storyline.

    <p>
      Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, twelve video
      albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos.
      The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six
      studio albums (beginning with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at
      number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most
      commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million
      albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the
      greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which
      ranked them at no. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. As of
      2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen
      SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million
      albums in the United States.
